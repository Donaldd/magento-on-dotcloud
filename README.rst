This is the easiest way to launch a Magento website on dotCloud, it takes less than 2 minutes to get your Magento site in the Cloud.
It works out of the box, just follow these easy steps and in the end you'll have our Magento site running on dotCloud.

To run this code on dotCloud, you need a FREE `dotCloud account
